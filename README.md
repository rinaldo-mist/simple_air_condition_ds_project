# Simple Air Condition Classifier

## Intro
In this project, I try to use ridge regression and lasso and explore it with another dataset. The data is provided publicly from https://data.jakarta.go.id/dataset/indeks-standar-pencemaran-udara-ispu-tahun-2021

The project is about to classify whether the air is fine enough or toxic based on provided dataset, in this case, Jakarta in 2021.
Sometimes we don't know how the experts determine how the air level and is it okay for us to breath it in. The aim in this project is to help us to identify the air quality of our surroundings. Perhaps, this project can help us to identify the issue and help us to tackle the problem.

## Disclaimer
**This project is made by a non-expert in this field. In this project, we are trying to achieve a model which help us to determine air condition from some basic understanding of data science perspective.**

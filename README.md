# Simple Air Condition Classifier

## Intro
Have you ever wondered that how is the air condition that we consume each second ? In this project, we try to use ridge regression and lasso and explore it with another dataset. Sometimes we don't know how the experts determine how the air level and is it okay for us to breath it in and the aim in this project is to help us to identify the air quality of our surroundings.

The project is about to classify whether the air is fine or not, based on provided dataset. In this case, we are focusing at Jakarta in 2021. Using several method of data science, perhaps, this project can help us to identify the issue and help us to tackle the problem further. The dataset is provided publicly from https://data.jakarta.go.id/dataset/indeks-standar-pencemaran-udara-ispu-tahun-2021

## Model Conclusion
The model achieved 88.06% accuracy by measuring it with MAPE method

## Disclaimer
**This project is made by a non-expert in this field. In this project, we are trying to achieve a model which help us to determine air condition from some basic understanding of data science perspective. The provided data is taken from government institute website.**
